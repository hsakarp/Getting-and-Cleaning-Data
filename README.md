# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

###"run_analysis.R" is merges the training and the test sets to create one data set,extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and then uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. It appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names and creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The code is commented properly and understandable.
